"778" "VADER" "You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did."
"779" "VADER" "There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
"780" "LUKE" "I'll never join you!"
"781" "VADER" "If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father."
"782" "LUKE" "He told me enough! He told me you killed him."
"783" "VADER" "No. I am your father."
"784" "LUKE" "No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!"
"785" "VADER" "Search your feelings. You know it to be true."
"786" "LUKE" "No! No! No!"
"787" "VADER" "Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
"788" "LUKE" "Ben...Ben, please!"
"789" "LUKE" "Ben. Leia!"
"790" "LUKE" "Hear me! Leia!"
